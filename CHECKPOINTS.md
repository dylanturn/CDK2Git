## Checkpoint 4 (2024-12-06)

### Fixed Git Protocol HEAD Reference and Object Handling

#### Changes Made
1. **Git References**
   - Added proper HEAD symref pointing to refs/heads/main
   - Implemented correct refs advertisement with capabilities
   - Fixed ref ordering and formatting in Git protocol response

2. **Pack Generation**
   - Improved object inclusion in pack files
   - Added consistent object sorting
   - Better organization of blobs, trees, and commits

3. **Object References**
   - Fixed HEAD reference resolution
   - Ensured consistent commit hash usage
   - Added proper symref capability advertisement

#### Technical Details
- Updated `get_refs()` to include both HEAD and main branch references
- Modified Git protocol response format to follow standard:
  ```
  # service=git-upload-pack
  0000
  [commit-hash] HEAD\0[capabilities]
  [commit-hash] refs/heads/main
  0000
  ```
- Improved pack generation with sorted objects for consistency
- Enhanced error handling and logging throughout the process

#### Status
- Successfully fixed the "remote HEAD refers to nonexistent ref" warning
- Improved Git protocol compliance
- Better handling of Git object references

#### Next Steps
1. Add more comprehensive testing for Git protocol handling
2. Implement branch management functionality
3. Add support for additional Git operations (push, fetch)
4. Consider adding authentication and access control
